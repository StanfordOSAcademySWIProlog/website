The website to accompany the Stanford Open Source Academy's Spring 2015 session SWI-Prolog group

This is the website that accompanies the Expert Systems project.

The website should be built so it can stand alone or be integrated with the SWI-Prolog website.

It should probably support being SWISH-ized

We should consider subsuming Learn Prolog Now into it

This should be a pack
